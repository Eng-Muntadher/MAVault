**MAVault** is a personal and social image gallery web app that brings together my passion for **photography** and **front-end development**.  
All the images on it are taken by me and uploaded to the app. It also allows users to share their photos, explore others’ work, and connect through comments, likes, and bookmarks — all in a beautifully responsive interface built with modern web technologies.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a personal image gallery built to merge my passion for **photography** — especially nature and lifestyle photography — with my passion for **front-end development**.  
It’s a space where I can display my own images and also allow users to create profiles, upload photos, and interact with others’ work through likes, bookmarks, and comments.

I designed this app to feel both personal and social — combining creativity, community, and customization.
