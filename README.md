## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a personal image gallery built to merge my passion for **photography** — especially nature and lifestyle photography — with my passion for **front-end development**.  
It’s a space where I can display my own images and also allow users to create profiles, upload photos, and interact with others’ work through likes, bookmarks, and comments.

I designed this app to feel both personal and social — combining creativity, community, and customization.
